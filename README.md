This project is actually 3 years older than all the web development projects as it was made when I first started learning to code locally in an academy in my town.

Console chess game made in Visual Studio using Visual Basic .NET

The interface is very rough /  almost non-existent, and the game has no AI but every chess piece follows the correct game rules and can only be moved and kill other pieces following them.

To play it we must specify the piece we want to move writing it as it is written in the table, then input the coordinates for the place where we want it to be placed. EX: "a3"

In-project comments are written in Spanish
